    <h1>Ghanian Birthday Name.</h1>
    <p>This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born.<br>
       Then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.<br>
       Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.<br>
       Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.<br> 
       Here are Ghanian day names:  
    </p>
    <ul>
        <b>Male</b>
        <li>Sunday: Kwasi</li>
        <li>Monday: Kwadwo</li>
        <li>Tuesday: Kwabena</li>
        <li>Wednesday: Kwaku</li>
        <li>Thursday:  Yaw</li>
        <li>Friday: Kofi</li>
        <li>Saturday: Kwame</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <b>Female</b>
        <li>Sunday: Akosua</li>
        <li>Monday: Adwoa</li>
        <li>Tuesday: Abenaa</li>
        <li>Wednesday: Akua</li>
        <li>Thursday:  Yaa</li>
        <li>Friday: Afua</li>
        <li>Saturday: Ama</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born.<br>
        Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date.</p>
